# Task Timer PWA - Coding Test

Welcome! You've been invited to complete a coding test for a part-time junior developer position.

## What This Is

Task Timer PWA is a simple productivity app created by Dan Donahue as a quick coding experiment. It helps people track tasks and stay focused. Your job is to add a new "Focus Timer" feature following the production manual.

## Your Mission

Add a focus timer feature that helps users stay on task with countdown alerts. You'll work through 5 chapters in the production manual, building the feature step-by-step.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the manual first**: Open `MANUAL.md` and read all 5 chapters
2. **Answer personal questions**: Fill out `CANDIDATE_ANSWERS.md` 
3. **Set up your environment**: Follow Chapter 1 instructions
4. **Build the feature**: Work through Chapters 2-4
5. **Submit**: Follow Chapter 5 to submit your work

## Timeline

- **Deadline**: 7 days from the day after you receive the invitation email
- **Reminder**: You'll get an auto-reminder on Day 5
- **Auto-close**: Submissions close automatically on Day 8

## What We're Looking For

- Can you follow detailed technical instructions?
- Do you catch obvious mistakes and use good judgment?
- Can you write tests (bonus points if you write tests FIRST)?
- Do you communicate clearly in your answers?
- Can you ship working code on time?

## Important Notes

- This is a **real coding test** - your submission will be auto-graded
- Work on **your local machine** in VS Code (not cloud IDEs)
- The starter app is already built - you just add the focus timer
- Ask Dan if you're truly stuck (but try to figure it out first!)

## Getting Help

If you hit a wall:
1. Re-read the manual chapter carefully
2. Check the console for errors
3. Google the error message
4. Ask Claude or ChatGPT (it's allowed!)
5. As a last resort, email Dan

## Starter App Overview

The app currently has:
- Task list (add, complete, delete tasks)
- TypeScript types
- Basic styling
- Component structure

You're adding:
- Focus timer component
- Countdown logic
- Audio alerts
- Integration with task list

## Tech Stack

- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite (fast dev server)
- Vitest (for testing)
- CSS (no framework - keep it simple)

## Grading

Your submission is graded on 7 criteria:
1. Personal questions answered (10 points)
2. Tests exist for timer component (10 points)
3. Tests written FIRST - Test-Driven Development (20 points bonus!)
4. Timer component renders (15 points)
5. Countdown works correctly (20 points)
6. Audio alert plays when timer ends (15 points)
7. Good judgment shown (caught the trap in Chapter 3) (10 points)

**Total possible: 100 points (or 110 with TDD bonus!)**

**Ready?** Open `MANUAL.md` and start with Chapter 1!

Good luck! 🚀
