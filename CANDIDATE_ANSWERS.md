## Question 1: Your Educational Path

I pursued this field because I am genuinely fascinated by how computers work—from understanding how machines communicate at a fundamental level to transforming logic into functional applications. Building applications is what truly excites me; it allows me to turn ideas into practical solutions and continuously challenges me to think critically and creatively. This passion for problem-solving and technology is what motivated me to choose Computer Science and continues to drive my growth in the field.]

## Question 3: Your Workspace & Tools

[I use an ROG Strix laptop equipped with 16GB of RAM, an AMD Ryzen 7 4800H processor running at 2.90 GHz, and an RTX 3050 GPU. My workspace is a clean, well-organized home setup designed to support focus and efficiency. It features a minimal desk with my laptop as the primary workstation, where I regularly work in a code editor for development tasks. Essential tools, notes, and tech accessories are neatly arranged to maintain an uncluttered environment, while the setup prioritizes comfort for extended work sessions. Overall, it reflects my organized work style, strong attention to detail, and commitment to delivering consistent, high-quality output.

One challenge with my current setup is the Windows operating system, which includes excessive bloatware, frequent forced updates, and persistent Microsoft product advertisements. Additionally, the MediaTek wireless adapter occasionally causes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity issues. Despite these limitations, I continue to maintain productivity and adapt effectively to my working environment.]

This upgrade would help improve my productivity and allow me to work more efficiently and consistently.]
